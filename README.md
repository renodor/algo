# Algorithm Exercises

Just me practicing with some common algorithm exercises on Codewars, Leetcode or Hackerrank. Whenever I spot one that relies on principles that I find interesting I copy it on this personal repo adding some personal comments and tests.

Each Ruby file is a separate exercise with :
1. The problem
2. My proposed solution
3. The rspec to test the solution
